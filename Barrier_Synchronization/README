This Document will help you run the codes on either jinx/local machine.

***** OpenMP *****
Contains subfolders Centralized and Dissemination for individual barrier implementations. Both folders have respective Makefiles.

OpenMP->Centralized: 
To run experiments locally, use python script as: python local_centralized_script.py. The results will be stored in centralized_results.txt file.
To run experiments on jinx, use bash script 'script.sh' as: qsub ./script.sh

OpenMP->Dissemination:
To run experiments locally, use python script as: python local_dissemination_script.py. The results will be stored in OpenMP_dissemination_results.txt file.
To run experiments on jinx, use bash script 'script.sh' as: qsub ./script.sh

***** MPI *****
Both folders contain Makefiles. Path for MPICC is set to the one needed to build the program on jinx cluster.
MPI->Dissemination : This folder contains default.c and default.h files which use the internal MPI barriers.
MPI->Dissemination->runscript.pbs / MPI->MCS->runscript.pbs : This script was used to schdule jobs on the cluster.
MPI->Dissemination->mpiConfig.sh / MPI->MCS->mpiConfig.sh : These scripts were used to actually run the MPI programs with different input parameters.

***** Combined *****
To run experiments locally, use command: mpirun -np [number_of_nodes] ./test_combined [number_of_threads]
To run experiments on jinx, use bash script 'script.sh' as: qsub ./script.sh
